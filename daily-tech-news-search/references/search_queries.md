## Date Handling


### China Timezone (UTC+8) Logic

```python
import datetime

def get_china_date():
    """Calculate current date in China timezone"""
    utc_now = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
    china_offset = datetime.timedelta(hours=8)
    china_now = utc_now + china_offset

    # If UTC time is before 16:00, China is already tomorrow
    if utc_now.hour < 16:
        search_date = china_now.date()
    else:
        search_date = (china_now + datetime.timedelta(days=1)).date()

    return search_date

# Example outputs:
# UTC 10:00 Nov 7 → China Nov 7 (search "November 7 2025")
# UTC 18:00 Nov 7 → China Nov 8 (search "November 8 2025")
```


```python
def generate_layer_dates(base_date, max_layers=8):
    """
    Generate date search targets for progressive backfill

    Args:
        base_date: Current China date
        max_layers: 0-7 (today through 7 days ago)

    Returns:
        List of (layer, date) tuples
    """
    layers = []
    for layer in range(max_layers):
        target_date = base_date - datetime.timedelta(days=layer)
        layers.append((layer, target_date))

    return layers

# Example usage:
china_date = get_china_date()  # 2025-11-17
layers = generate_layer_dates(china_date)

# Output:
# [(0, 2025-11-17),  # Layer 0: Today
#  (1, 2025-11-16),  # Layer 1: Yesterday
```

### Date Query Generation

```python
def generate_date_query(target_date):
    """
    Generate multiple date format variations for robust search

    Args:
        target_date: datetime.date object

    Returns:
        List of date strings in various formats
    """
    formats = [
        target_date.strftime("%B %d, %Y"),     # November 17, 2025
        target_date.strftime("%b %d %Y"),      # Nov 17 2025
        target_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),      # 2025-11-17
        target_date.strftime("%d %B %Y"),      # 17 November 2025
    ]

    # Add relative terms for Layer 0
    if is_today(target_date):
        formats.extend(["today", "今天"])

    return formats

def build_search_query(base_query, layer, target_date):
    """
    Build complete search query with date filters

    Args:
        base_query: Core search terms (e.g., "OpenAI news")
        layer: Time layer (0-7)
        target_date: Date to search for

    Returns:
        Complete search query string
    """
    date_formats = generate_date_query(target_date)

    # Create OR clause for date formats
    date_clause = " OR ".join([f'"{df}"' for df in date_formats])

    # Combine with base query
    query = f'{base_query} AND ({date_clause})'

    return query

# Example:
# Layer 0 (Today):
#   'OpenAI news AND ("November 17, 2025" OR "Nov 17 2025" OR "2025-11-17" OR "today" OR "今天")'
#
# Layer 1 (Yesterday):
#   'OpenAI news AND ("November 16, 2025" OR "Nov 16 2025" OR "2025-11-16")'
```

### Search Execution Strategy

```python
def progressive_search(target_count=50):
    """
    Execute progressive time-layered search

    Strategy:
    1. Start with Layer 0 (today)
    2. If count < 50, search Layer 1 (yesterday)
    3. Continue through Layers 2-7 until target reached
    """
    china_date = get_china_date()
    all_items = []
    layer = 0

    while len(all_items) < target_count and layer <= 7:
        # Calculate target date for this layer
        target_date = china_date - datetime.timedelta(days=layer)

        # Build and execute search
        queries = build_company_queries(target_date, layer)
        results = execute_search(queries)

        # Filter and process
        filtered = filter_by_quality(results)

        if layer == 0:
            # Layer 0: Accept all quality items
            all_items.extend(filtered)
        else:
            # Layer 1+: Intelligent supplementation
            needed = target_count - len(all_items)
            supplements = select_supplements(
                current_items=all_items,
                candidates=filtered,
                needed=needed,
                layer=layer
            )
            all_items.extend(supplements)

        layer += 1

    return all_items
```

### Date Format Variations

Use multiple formats for maximum coverage:

```
Standard Formats:
- "November 7, 2025"
- "Nov 7 2025"
- "2025-11-07"
- "7 November 2025"

Relative Terms (Layer 0 only):
- "today"
- "今天" (Chinese)
- "last 24 hours"

Layer-Specific Hints:
- Layer 0: "breaking", "just announced", "launches today"
- Layer 1: "yesterday", "昨天"
```
